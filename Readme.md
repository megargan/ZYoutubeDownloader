**YoutubeDownloader** is an application that lets you download videos from YouTube.
You can copy-paste URL of any video, playlist or channel and download it directly in a format of your choice.
It also supports searching by keywords, which is helpful if you want to quickly look up and download videos.

> [!NOTE]
> This application uses [**YoutubeExplode**](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode) under the hood to interact with YouTube.
> You can [read this article](https://tyrrrz.me/blog/reverse-engineering-youtube-revisited) to learn more about how it works.
